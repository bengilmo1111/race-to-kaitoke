###Performance + Stability Focus

your job is to improve performance, stability, and load times. First play the game and identify any jank: stutters, slow startup, memory spikes, long GC pauses, input lag, or frame drops. Then pick a few high-impact fixes (rendering, physics timestep, pooling, asset loading, scene graph cleanup, batching, culling, audio, etc.) and implement them. After each change, thoroughly test by playing and confirm FPS and responsiveness improved with no regressions. If you find crashes, console errors, or flaky behavior, prioritize fixing them.

###UX + Accessibility Focus (kid-friendly usability)

your job is to improve the user experience and accessibility for kids 8–10. First play the game and note any confusion: unclear goals, hard-to-read UI, tricky controls, missing feedback, frustrating menus, or unclear progression. Then implement improvements such as clearer prompts, simpler menus, bigger hit targets, remappable keys, pause/help screens, colorblind-safe indicators, and readable typography.

Ensure art_direction.md is respected.

###Game Feel + Juice Focus (feedback, polish, delight)

your job is to improve “game feel” and polish. First play the game and identify where it feels flat: weak feedback, unclear collisions, unexciting moments, dull movement, or boring interactions. Then add juice such as: screen shake (carefully), squash/stretch, hit-stop, better particles, sound cues, animation timing, camera behavior, responsive controls, satisfying rewards etc. After each change, thoroughly test by playing and confirm it feels better and remains readable for kids. Fix any bugs you notice. Ensure art_direction.md is respected.

###Progression + Replayability Focus

First play the game and identify what’s missing to keep players engaged for thee whole game: shallow goals, lack of variety, no longer-term rewards, or repetitive loops. Then add systems like simple achievements, unlockables, level modifiers, daily/weekly challenges (local-only), score combos, collectibles, difficulty ramps, or new level patterns—keeping the design kid-friendly and not grindy. After each feature, thoroughly test by playing and confirm it’s fun and doesn’t break existing progression. Fix bugs you find. Ensure art_direction.md is respected.

###Content + Variety Focus (levels, enemies, obstacles, events)

your job is to add more content variety while preserving the game’s core design. First play the game and identify repeated patterns: same obstacles, same pacing, same environments, same outcomes. Then implement a small set of new content elements (new obstacle types, enemy behaviors, hazards, interactive props, level chunks, or event sequences) that reuse existing systems where possible. After each addition, thoroughly test by playing and confirm the new content works, feels fair, and integrates cleanly. Fix any bugs you notice. Ensure art_direction.md is respected.
